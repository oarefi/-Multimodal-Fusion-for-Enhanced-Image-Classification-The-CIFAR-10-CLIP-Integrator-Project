# -Multimodal-Fusion-for-Enhanced-Image-Classification-The-CIFAR-10-CLIP-Integrator-Project

Overview
The CIFAR-10 CLIP Integrator Project aims to create a robust image classification system by leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's CLIP model and integrating it with a custom neural network. This project focuses on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of ten categories, using a multimodal approach that combines image and text features.

Features
Custom CLIP Classifier: Combines CLIP's pre-trained model with a tailored neural network for enhanced feature extraction and classification.
K-Fold Cross-Validation: Ensures model robustness and generalizability across different dataset partitions.
High Accuracy: Demonstrates exceptional classification performance on CIFAR-10 dataset.
PyTorch Framework: Utilizes the flexible and powerful PyTorch library for model development and training.

Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:


Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It's widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

Model Architecture
The CustomCLIPClassifier integrates CLIP's image and text encoding capabilities.
The classifier section consists of Linear, BatchNorm1d, ReLU, and Dropout layers, culminating in a final classification layer.
Training and Validation
The model is trained for 5 epochs across 5 folds in a K-Fold Cross-Validation setup.
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and CrossEntropyLoss as the loss function are used.
Training details, including loss and accuracy, are logged for each fold.
Results
The model achieves 100% accuracy across all folds in the cross-validation, indicative of its strong performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Future Work
Evaluate the model on an independent test set.
Explore hyperparameter tuning and additional regularization methods.
Investigate potential overfitting and implement strategies to mitigate it.
